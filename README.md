# Intro to Mathematical Modeling & Visualization in Python

*Author: Mark Rosin*

Welcome to this fourth Data Storytelling Lab workshop, *Intro to Mathematical Modeling & Visualization in Python*. 

In scientific contexts data is how we describe the world. It is the result of experiments and measuring naturally occuring phenomena. The same is true in epidemiology (think COVID-19 policy), commerce (sales forecasts), finance (investing), marketing (pricing), and weather forecasting, for example. Data tell us how the world is. But, on its own, it tell us nothing about how the world ought to be, or how it will be the future.

However, with the right tools we can use data to extrapolate from the current state of affairs to make predictions about future scenarios. We call this mathematical modelling. Sometimes this can be done using pencil and paper, but increasingly these mathematical models can only be solved on a computer. The results given by these models are known as simulation data.

In this session we'll introduce the concept of mathematical modelling through a simple, but rich, test case. Please navigate to the python notebook to follow along. 

# Learning Outcomes

1. Understand that a wide range of phenomena can be approximated by a mathematical model.
2. Recognize that data can be both an input and an output from a mathematical model. 
3. Identify the key components of a model: data, variables, parameters, and update rules.

# Workflow

We will be working entirely in a single Google Colab notebook. This requies an internet connection and a google account (your Pratt email is powered by Google and will suffice). To edit the notebook, make your own copy and save it to your drive.
